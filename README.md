Project Description
In this project, we seek to tackle the important problem of predicting students' academic success and identifying potential dropouts. By employing machine learning algorithms, we can analyze various input features, including demographic information, academic history, and more, to make predictions.

Data
# Example Data Sources
Data source gotten from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success
Data Preprocessing
Data was pre processed using Pandas.
Machine Learning Models
skitlearn and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique were used

Getting Started
# Prerequisites:
Python3 jupyter Notebook
bash
Copy code
# Example installation instructions
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Usage Jupyter Notebook
Execute this to select your desired classifier
'''SelectedClassifier = input("Select your classifier, KNN-Classifier, RandomForest, Logistic-Regression, and Decision-Tree")
print(SelectedClassifier)'''
# Example usage in .py 
python3 Dropout_Classification_ML_Project.py
# Results
Random forest classiifer outperforms becasue of its ability to prune and its Ensemble Method.
